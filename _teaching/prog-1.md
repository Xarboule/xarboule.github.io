Teacher Assistant for the Python course (beginner level).

This course is a first contact with programming for most of the students. The course is given to undergraduate students, in several fields but Computer Science (Biology, natural systems, Maths...)

Discovery of Python
======
- First tests with the Python REPL.
- Basic programming concepts (variables, loops, functions)

(The Object Oriented paradigm is not included in this course. Some of the students eventually discover it in the following semester.)

Project
======
As soon as the basic concepts are understood, students are starting a project. In the past, the project has either been :

- *Robotics :* Programming LEGO Mindstorm robots, in micro-Python
- *Board Games :* Programming a board game of their choice. (Connect four, chess, (m,n,k)-game...)
