Where am I?
======

My name is Rémi Dulong, and I am a PhD Student in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. I am part of the Computer Science institute of the University, in the *Complex Systems research group*. 
On this website, you can find my publications, information about me, and eventually some ideas I would like to share in a blog (mostly about computer science).

What are you working on?
=======

My field is Computer Science, and more precisely, how the Operating System is interacting with its hardware. My PhD is focused on a new emerging technology, called *Non-Volatile Main Memory*. 
In a nutshell, this type of memory looks like a RAM module, has comparable performances, but its content is not lost when your computer is turned off.
